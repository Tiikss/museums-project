                    <p>The European Network of Museums is a network of historical museums in European cities, with a
                        focus
                        on
                        the recent history of the European continent and the process of European integration. It is an
                        initiative of the European Parliament, and it was opened on May 6, 2017.</p>

                    <h1>Our story</h1>
                    <p>The museums offer a unique view of the continent's history. They have a transnational approach to
                        the
                        main events and phenomena that have united and divided Europeans through time and different
                        legacies
                        and
                        interpretations of its history. While learning about Europe's past, visitors are encouraged to
                        think
                        critically about its present in order to engage in its future.</p>

                    <h1>Mission statement</h1>
                    <p>Our mission is to feed curiosity and enhance the understanding of a shared European history. We
                        offer
                        diverse interpretations that not only consider the facts, but also the stories and human
                        experiences
                        behind them. We encourage our audience and partners to be an active part of building our vision
                        through
                        the collection of historical sources, confronting of memories, and collaborating and engaging
                        with
                        others. We want our visitors to question assumptions and exchange ideas about the past, to act
                        today
                        and
                        shape tomorrow. We keep our mission at the heart of everything we do.</p>
