                        Europe.</p>

            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>The European Network of Museums is a network of historical museums in European cities, with a focus on
                the recent history of the European continent and the process of European integration. It is an
                initiative of the European Parliament, and it was opened on May 6, 2017.</p>

            <h1>Our story</h1>
            <p>The museums offer a unique view of the continent's history. They have a transnational approach to the
                main events and phenomena that have united and divided Europeans through time and different legacies and
                interpretations of its history. While learning about Europe's past, visitors are encouraged to think
                critically about its present in order to engage in its future.</p>

            <h1>Mission statement</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to feed curiosity and enhance the understanding of a shared European history. We offer
                diverse interpretations that not only consider the facts, but also the stories and human experiences
                behind them. We encourage our audience and partners to be an active part of building our vision through
                the collection of historical sources, confronting of memories, and collaborating and engaging with
                others. We want our visitors to question assumptions and exchange ideas about the past, to act today and
                shape tomorrow. We keep our mission at the heart of everything we do.</p>
