                        The Louvre, or the Louvre Museum, is the world's largest
                        art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France. A
                        central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right
                        Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement.
                        Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st
                        century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square
                        meters. In 2019, the Louvre received 9.6 million
                        visitors, making it the most visited museum in the
                        world.

                    <p>
                        The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally
                        built as the Louvre castle in the late 12th to 13th
                        century under Philip II. Remnants of the fortress are
                        visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban
                        expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive
                        function, and in 1546, Francis I converted it into the
                        primary residence of the French Kings. The building was
                        extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace.
                        In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for
                        his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place
                        to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a
                        collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In
                        1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des
                        Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Académie Royale
                        de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the
                        first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at
                        the Louvre for 100 years.

                        During the French Revolution, the National Assembly
                        decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to
                        display the nation's masterpieces. The museum opened on
                        10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the
                        majority of the works being royal and confiscated church
                        property. Because of structural problems with the
                        building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The
                        collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum
                        was renamed Musée Napoléon, but after Napoleon's
                        abdication, many works seized by his armies were
                        returned to their original owners. The collection was
                        further increased during the reigns of Louis
